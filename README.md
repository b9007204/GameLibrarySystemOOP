--------------------------------------------------What Happens So Far--------------------------------------------------

The System will let a user browse the store without being logged in, although buying games is impossible and a blocking 
message will inform them of that.

Once logged in, the user can browse the store and purchase games, if they have enough credits. Once bought, this game will 
have a (Game Owned) message beside it, and the game will also appear in the profile menu of that user under bought games.

The user can also see their profile, this will show them the games they own, and also the credits they own.

The user can also search for games, by text only, but the search is case sensitive. Fixing this currently.

The user can also buy credits from  credits menu. They can buy from 10 to 2000 credits which will appear in their account and 
let them purchase games.

The user can also log out.





Cheers!
